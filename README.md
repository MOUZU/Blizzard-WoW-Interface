# Blizzard WoW Interface
In this repository I extracted Blizzards UI source code to use as reference for own AddOn development projects. These files should be the most recent ones for the mentioned Client & Patch Versions.

## Extraction process
I used the Software <b>MyWarCraftStudio (0.10.6337)</b> to extract the files from my local WoW installations. In the following I document the steps I followed to get to these results. In case you want to do the same or to point out mistakes.

### 1.12.1
